# Contiguous Memory Allocation Project

This project is an implementation of **Contiguous Memory Allocation** in C language. The project demonstrates how memory is allocated in contiguous blocks, an important concept in computer systems and memory management.

## Project Overview

In this project, we simulate the process of allocating memory in contiguous blocks for a system. The program demonstrates how the operating system can manage memory allocation and deal with situations like fragmentation and memory allocation efficiency.

## Features

- **Memory Allocation**: Allocating a block of memory to processes.
- **Deallocation**: Freeing up memory that is no longer in use.
- **Fragmentation**: Simulating the effects of memory fragmentation.
- **Memory Management Algorithms**: Implementing simple memory allocation strategies.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contiguous-memory-allocation.git
